# Tabelog TUI - User Guide

## Launch the TUI

Use one of the following commands to start the interactive TUI:

## Interface Overview

The TUI is divided into four main areas:

  - Tip: press `F3` to open intelligent keyword suggestions (`New!`)
    - When the keyword is empty: shows the full list of 45+ cuisine categories
    - When the keyword has content: calls the API and shows dynamic suggestions such as cuisine types, restaurant names, and combined keywords
  - Automatically detects cuisine names and converts them into precise filters

**Second row - Sort options**

## Typical Workflow

### Basic flow

1. Start the TUI with `uv run gurume tui`
2. Enter an area in the Area input box, for example `東京`
3. Press `Tab` to move to the Keyword input box and enter a keyword, for example `寿司`
4. Press `Tab` to move to the sort options and choose a sort mode with the arrow keys. The default is Rating ranking.
5. Click the Search button or press `Enter` in an input box to run the search
6. Wait for the search to complete. Results will appear in the left-hand results list
7. Use `↑` / `↓` or click an item to select a restaurant
8. Detailed information is shown automatically in the right-hand detail panel
9. You can update the search conditions and search again at any time. The previous search is cancelled automatically
10. Press `q` to quit

### Using area suggestions (recommended)

1. Start the TUI with `uv run gurume tui`
2. Enter an area keyword in the Area input box, for example `東京` or `伊勢`
3. Press `F2` to open the area suggestion popup
4. Use `↑` / `↓` to choose a suggested area or station
5. Press `Enter` to confirm, or press `Esc` to cancel
6. The selected area is filled into the input box automatically
7. Continue entering keywords and run the search

**Why use area suggestions?**

- Ensures the area name is valid and reduces failed searches
- Automatically provides prefecture, major station, and area options
- Supports area filtering so the results stay in the selected region instead of falling back to nationwide results

### Using intelligent keyword suggestions (recommended, `New!`)

The `F3` key supports two modes and switches automatically based on the keyword input content.

**Mode 1: Empty keyword -> full cuisine category list**

1. Start the TUI with `uv run gurume tui`
2. Make sure the Keyword input box is empty
3. Press `F3` to open the cuisine category selector popup
4. Use `↑` / `↓` to browse 45+ cuisine types
5. Press `Enter` to confirm, or press `Esc` to cancel
6. The selected cuisine name is filled into the Keyword input box automatically
7. The system uses the cuisine category code for precise filtering

**Mode 2: Keyword has content -> dynamic API suggestions (`New!`)**

1. Enter a partial keyword in the Keyword input box, for example `すき`
2. Press `F3` to call the Tabelog API and fetch suggestions
3. The system shows related suggestions, including:
   - Cuisine types, for example `すき焼き`, `寿司`
   - Restaurant names, for example `和田金`
   - Combined keywords, for example `すき焼き ランチ`
4. Use `↑` / `↓` to select a suggestion
5. Press `Enter` to confirm
6. The selected content is filled into the Keyword input box automatically

**Why use intelligent keyword suggestions?**

- **Precise filtering**: only shows restaurants that match the selected cuisine type, such as dedicated `すき焼き` restaurants
- **Discovery**: browse all 45+ cuisine types when the keyword box is empty
- **Dynamic suggestions**: get real-time suggestions while typing, including cuisines, restaurants, and combinations
- **Fewer typos**: choosing from a list keeps names accurate
- **Automatic conversion**: the system converts cuisine names into Tabelog cuisine codes automatically, for example `すき焼き` -> `RC0107`

**Direct cuisine input also works**

- Enter a cuisine name directly in the Keyword input box, for example `すき焼き`, `寿司`, or `ラーメン`
- The system detects it automatically and converts it into a precise filter
- Auto-detection supports all 45+ cuisine categories

### Natural-language input

The TUI no longer parses free-form text on its own. To translate sentences like `我想吃三重的壽喜燒` into the Area and Keyword fields, use an AI assistant with the [`gurume-cli` agent skill](https://github.com/narumiruna/gurume/tree/main/skills/gurume-cli) installed and let it tell you which values to type.

## Example Searches

### Search for sushi in Tokyo (rating ranking)

- Area: `東京`
- Keyword: `寿司`
- Sort: `Rating ranking`

### Search for ramen in Osaka (review count)

- Area: `大阪`
- Keyword: `ラーメン`
- Sort: `Review count`

### Search for washoku in Kyoto (new openings)

- Area: `京都`
- Keyword: `和食`
- Sort: `New openings`

### Search for dedicated `すき焼き` restaurants in Mie (using cuisine categories)

- Method 1: use the `F3` selector
  1. Press `F3` to open the cuisine category selector
  2. Choose `すき焼き`
  3. Enter the area: `三重`
  4. Run the search
- Method 2: direct input
  1. Area: `三重`
  2. Keyword: `すき焼き` (the system detects it automatically and applies precise filtering)
  3. Run the search
- Result: only dedicated `すき焼き` restaurants are shown, such as `和田金` and `牛銀本店`, instead of unrelated restaurant types

## Notes

- **Area filtering limitations**
  - Supported: all 47 prefectures
  - Not supported: exact city-, town-, village-, or station-level filtering
  - Recommendation: use area suggestions with `F2` and select a prefecture to ensure filtering works as expected
- Searches may take a few seconds, depending on network conditions
- Make sure you have a working internet connection
- Search results depend on Tabelog site availability
- A larger terminal window is recommended for the best experience. `80x24` is the suggested minimum
- Re-running a search cancels the previous one automatically to avoid concurrency issues
- All search results use Tabelog's native sorting, not client-side sorting
